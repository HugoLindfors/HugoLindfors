- 👋 Hi! My name is Hugo Lindfors (@HugoLindfors) and I am from Stockholm, Sweden.

- 📚 I have a High School Diploma from *LBS Kreativa Gymnasiet Stockholm South* and soon a Dertified Upper Secondary School Engineering Degree in Software Development from *NTI Gymnasiet Stockholm Odenplan*.

- 👀 I'm currently interested in STEM-subjects and linguistics.

- 🌐 I can speak Swedish (Native), English (C1/C2), Finnish (B1/B2), and German (B1/B2) to varying degrees. I'm also intrested in a slew of other languages including Japanese, Hebrew, Russian, Polish, Estonian and Hungarian just to mention a few.
