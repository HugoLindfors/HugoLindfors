Hi! I'm Hugo and I am an aspiring Software Developer from Stockholm, Sweden currently looking for jobs in Frontend Web Development.

Currently, I'm working on a Genealogy Website as a hobby project using Vue with TypeScript at the frontend and .NET Core at the backend.

I'm currently into *linguistics*.

I can communicate professionally in Swedish (Native), English (C1), Finnish (B2), and German (B1). I also pocess smaller grasp in a slew of other languages including Latin, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Polish, Estonian and Hungarian just to mention a few.
